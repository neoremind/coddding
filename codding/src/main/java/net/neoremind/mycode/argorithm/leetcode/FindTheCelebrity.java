/**
 * Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist one celebrity.
 * The definition of a celebrity is that all the other n - 1people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.
 * <p>
 * Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to
 * do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out
 * the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).
 * <p>
 * You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function int
 * findCelebrity(n), your function should minimize the number of calls to knows.
 * <p>
 * Note: There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a
 * celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   int res = 0;
 *         for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
 *             if (knows(res, i)) res = i;
 *         }
 *         for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
 *             if (res != i && (knows(res, i) || !knows(i, res))) return -1;
 *         }
 *         return res;
 * </pre>
